# Header Hero (Fork)

BitSquid back in 2011 released a nifty tool for analysing C++ header includes, see
[Caring by Sharing: Header Hero](https://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2011/10/caring-by-sharing-header-hero.html) blog post.

Back in 2018 I made some functionality and UX improvements to it, see
[Header Hero Improvements](https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/01/17/Header-Hero-Improvements/) blog post. This
is that code.

The original Bitbucket repositories of both the original & the improvements forks are gone by now.
